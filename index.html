                { q: "What is the 'memoryless' property of the Geometric distribution?", a: "<h3>Answer</h3><p>It means the past failures don't affect future probabilities. <br>P(X > n + k | X > n) = P(X > k).<br>If you've already flipped 10 tails, the chance of flipping 3 more tails before a head is the *same* as the chance of flipping 3 tails from the start.</p>" },

                { q: "What is the expected value (mean) of an Exponential distribution with rate &lambda;?", a: "<h3>Answer</h3><p>E[X] = 1 / &lambda;<br><br>Explanation: If the rate (&lambda;) is 5 calls/hour, the mean time *between* calls (E[X]) is 1/5 = 0.2 hours (or 12 minutes).</p>" },

                { q: "What is the 'memoryless' property of the Exponential distribution?", a: "<h3>Answer</h3><p>The time already waited doesn't affect the future. <br>P(X > s + t | X > s) = P(X > t).<br>If a lightbulb (modeled by Exp.) has already lasted 100 hours, its probability of lasting *another* 50 hours is the same as a new bulb's probability of lasting 50 hours.</p>" },
                { q: "What is the shape of every Exponential distribution?", a: "<h3>Answer</h3><p>Always skewed to the right. The most likely waiting time is very short (close to 0), and long waiting times are increasingly rare.</p>" },

This leaves 5% in the two tails. Since the curve is symmetric, half of that (2.5%) is in the upper tail (above 130).</p>" },
                { q: "What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)?", a: "<h3>Answer</h3><p>The CLT states that the *sampling distribution of the sample mean* (the distribution of many sample means) will be approximately Normally distributed, *regardless* of the original population's distribution, as long as the sample size (n) is large enough (e.g., n > 30).</p>" },
                { q: "Why is the Central Limit Theorem so important?", a: "<h3>Answer</h3><p>It allows us to use Normal distribution properties to make inferences (like confidence intervals and hypothesis tests) about a population mean, even if we don't know the population's shape.</p>" },

                { q: "What happens to the Standard Error (&sigma; / &radic;n) as the sample size (n) increases?", a: "<h3>Answer</h3><p>It decreases.

                { q: "Why does the t-distribution approach the Z-distribution as 'n' gets large?", a: "<h3>Answer</h3><p>Because as the sample size (n) increases, the sample standard deviation (s) becomes a much more reliable and accurate estimate of the true population standard deviation (&sigma;). The 'extra uncertainty' vanishes.</p>" },
